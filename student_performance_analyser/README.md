Student Performance Analyzer 📊

A beginner-friendly data analysis project built using **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib** to analyze and visualize student academic performance.



📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student marks data to:
- Calculate total and average marks
- Assign grades based on performance
- Identify top-performing and weak students
- Analyze subject-wise difficulty and consistency
- Visualize insights using charts



 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib


 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains marks of students in different subjects.

**Columns:**
- `STUDENT_NAME`
- `MATHEMATICS`
- `SCIENCE`
- `APTITUDE`

Each row represents one student.


 📊 Analysis Performed
- Total and average marks per student
- Grade assignment (A, B, C, Fail)
- Identification of top-performing student
- Subject-wise average marks
- Variance and standard deviation analysis to measure consistency



 📈 Visualizations
- Subject-wise average marks (Bar chart)
- Student-wise average marks (Line plot)
- Marks distribution (Histogram)
- Grade distribution (Pie chart)
- Standard deviation comparison across subjects (Bar chart)



 🔍 Key Insights
- Science has the highest average score but also high variability
- Mathematics has lower average performance and high inconsistency
- Aptitude shows moderate performance with mixed results
- Student performance varies significantly across subjects
- Standard deviation highlights uneven performance patterns



 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `students_analysis.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially



 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates fundamental data analysis skills using Python libraries and provides meaningful insights into student performance.
